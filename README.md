# VSCode-Snippet-Tool
Incredibly basic tool for creating snippets for VSCode, using Java 8.

Compile it and you are good to go (if you don't trust, just look at it. Super short and readable code). Window pops up, you just input the name, scope, prefix and paste your code.
Finished snippet is copied to your clipboard you ten just paste it into your .vscode/snippets.code-snippets

If you don't know how to make/use snippets in VSCode I refer you to the official site: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets
